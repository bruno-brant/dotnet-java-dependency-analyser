# Java Dependency Analyser

A parser for a subset of Java's grammar that produces a nice depency graph between classes, written using .NET 5.0 and [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache).

This was developed as part of an article in [my blog](https://blog.brunobrant.net/parsing-code-with-sprache/).
